          <b>Nomination:</b><span>&#8220;</span>She has been a critical member of the team and key to Payroll’s success. As our Scrum Master, she motivates the team, promotes good Agile practices, 
          and keeps our board organized. Susannah goes above and beyond to assist with any tasks, even outside her responsibilities. Her recent efforts to update our scrum 
          documentation and reorganize the Confluence site have been invaluable to the team.<span>&#8221;</span></br>

          <b>Award:</b>Employee of the Month <br/>
          <b>Nomination:</b><span>&#8220;</span>Please join me in congratulating our August Employee of the Month, Susannah Bear Garlid!
          Over the last months, Susannah has been instrumental in improving our portal release process and related documentation and tracking tools. 
          Susannah drove this improvement initiative while also covering release manager and scrum master responsibilities for the portal (an open position), 
          helping train and onboard the person filling that position, AND helping lead the DCI transition from Google to SharePoint for document storage. 
          Thank you, Susannah, for your servant leadership and passion for continuous improvement!
          Congratulations, Susannah, and thank you for all that you do.<span>&#8221;</span> </br>

          <b>Award:</b>Team Hero Award <br/>
          <b>Nomination:</b><span>&#8220;</span>Susannah Bear Garlid has been selected for the Team Hero award based on her recent above-and-beyond 
          efforts to help us better structure and organize our DCI documentation and information as we migrate from Google Drive to Microsoft SharePoint 
          and OneDrive. Susannah took the initiative to create a DCI-wide SharePoint which will organize all our department and product pages and to serve 
          as an MVP version of a DCI company intranet, as well as supported several department leads to help them set up their page structure. A wise person 
          at DCI recently reminded me the most effective teams optimize for the retrieval of information, not immediate transfer of information – 
          and I think Susannah’s work will help us take a big step in that direction! Thank you, Susannah!<span>&#8221;</span> </br>

          <b>Award:</b>Team Hero Award <br/>
          <b>Nomination:</b><span>&#8220;</span>I would like to nominate Susannah Bear for the Team Hero Award. On very short notice, Susannah was asked to step in as 
          Scrum Master for the Payroll Engine team in order to keep some of their standing ceremonies moving forward. My only ask of her was to maintain, as she has other 
          responsibilities and projects taking her time and focus. However, through this transition, I learned that all-day, in person working sessions had been planned with
          Acumen to do a deep dive into product development needs for the Acumen Tax Team. I asked Susannah to please try to do what she could do to pull that working session 
          together to make it meaningful. In 4 business days, Susannah created a Payroll Engine Calendar and organized all of their standing meetings, created a newly organized 
          Teams channel, facilitated their daily stand-ups and refinement sessions, met with all Payroll Engine stakeholders (internally and externally) to gather feedback and 
          prepare for the working sessions with Acumen, and then confidently facilitated a grueling working session with key stakeholders. Susannah stepped up in a time of need,
          and certainly exceeded expectations! Thank you, Susannah Bear!<span>&#8221;</span> </br>
